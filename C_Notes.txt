==>What is C
   .........
C is a programming language developed at AT & T's Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972.

It was designed and written by a man named Dennis Ritchie. It is one of the most popular computer languages today because of its structure, high-level abstraction, machine independent feature.

==>C has become very popular for various reasons
   .............................................

-->One of the early programming languages.
-->Still, the best programming language to learn quickly.
-->C language is reliable, simple and easy to use.
-->C language is a structured language.
-->Modern programming concepts are based on C.
-->It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.

==>Advantages of c
   ...............

-->C is very suitable for system programming
-->C encourages the code reusability
-->C encourages the structured programming.
-->The different modules can be present in different source files and they can be compiled separately.
-->C is one of the most portable languages.
-->C supports a number of data types.

==>Disadvantages of C
   ..................

-->C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
-->There are no concepts of Namespace in C.
-->C does not provide binding or wrapping up of data in a single unit.
-->C does not provide Constructor and Destructor.

==>C KeyWords
   ...........
Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier. For example:

int money;

Here, int is a keyword that indicates money is a variable of type int (integer).

==>C Identifiers
   .............
Identifier refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions, structures etc.

Identifiers must be unique. They are created to give a unique name to an entity to identify it during the execution of the program. For example:

int money;
double accountBalance;

Here, money and accountBalance are identifiers.

Rules for naming identifiers
............................

-->A valid identifier can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscores.
-->The first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an underscore.
-->You cannot use keywords as identifiers.
-->There is no rule on how long an identifier can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the identifier is longer than 31 characters.

==>Variables
   ..........

In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location. For example:

int playerScore = 95;
Here, playerScore is a variable of int type. Here, the variable is assigned an integer value 95.

The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.

char ch = 'a';
// some code
ch = 'l';

==>Rules for naming a variable
   ............................

A variable name can have only letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.
The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.
There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.
Note: You should always try to give meaningful names to variables. For example: firstName is a better variable name than fn.

C is a strongly typed language. This means that the variable type cannot be changed once it is declared. For example:

int number = 5;      // integer variable
number = 5.5;        // error
double number;       // error
Here, the type of number variable is int. You cannot assign a floating-point (decimal) value 5.5 to this variable. Also, you cannot redefine the data type of the variable to double. By the way, to store the decimal values in C, you need to declare its type to either double or float.

==> Format Specifiers in C
    .......................
Format specifiers defines the type of data to be printed on standard output or the type of the data to be taken as Input  .The format specifier is used during input and output. It is a way to tell the compiler what type of data is in a variable during taking input using scanf() or printing using printf().
Some examples are %c, %d, %f, etc.

--> Used with Scanf() Statement are 

%C --> Read a Character

%d --> Read a Decimal Integer

%e --> Read a Float

%f --> Read a Float

%g --> Read a Float 

%h --> Read a Short Integer

%i --> Read a Decimal || Hexadecimal || Octal integer

%o --> Read a Octal Integer

%s --> Read String of Characters

%u --> Read Unsigned Integer

%x --> Read a Hexadecimal Integer

%[] -->Read a String of words

%d (print as a decimal integer)

%6d (print as a decimal integer with a width of at least 6 wide)

%06d (print as a decimal integer with a width of at least 6 wide,precedes with 0)

%f (print as a floating point)

%4f (print as a floating point with a width of at least 4 wide)

%.4f (print as a floating point with a precision of four characters after the decimal point)

%3.2f (print as a floating point at least 3 wide and a precision of 2)
